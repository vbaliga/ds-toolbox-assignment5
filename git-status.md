# Definition: git status

The `git status` command provides an overview of the current status of the working directory as well as changes that have been staged or remain unstaged. It also shows the locations of untracked files. The current branch you are working on is reported, along with whether the local branch is ahead or behind a tracked remote branch.

Many of these aspects can be seen in the JupyterLab IDE by viewing the "Git" tab. The "Current Repository" and "Current Branch" are listed (along with dropdown menus to switch the branch). All changes (staged, unstaged, untracked) are shown in the "Changes" tab, and the "History" reflects what has been pushed and/or merged in the past.
